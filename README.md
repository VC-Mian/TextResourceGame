# TextResourceGame
In developing the Text Management Game, I gained valuable insights into object-oriented programming principles, particularly in encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. By structuring the game with distinct classes for resources, generators, and events, I learned the importance of organizing functionality into modular, reusable components. This project emphasized encapsulation through the use of private variables and public methods, which safeguarded the state of game objects and enhanced flexibility. Implementing thread management for timed events introduced me to multi-threading, allowing for a smoother game flow. Additionally, I learned how to utilize randomization and conditional logic to create dynamic gameplay elements, such as the werewolf encounter. The experience of handling user input with the Scanner class taught me how to create an interactive command-line interface that enhances user experience. Moreover, the project deepened my understanding of game mechanics and resource management, challenging me to think critically about balancing these aspects within the code structure. Overall, this project solidified my technical skills and knowledge of core OOP concepts and game design principles.

The goal of the game is to accumulate the most resources before the player's health reaches zero, or until they get bored of the game. Players have a selection of options and can choose each with the assigned numbers. Players have three main resources to collect wood, iron, and chicken. Health can be collected when chicken is eaten to replenish health. These resources are used to build generators to get more of these resources. There is no limit to how many generators can be made. This game can be played slowly or quickly as long as the player can keep track of their health. There is an event that severely damages the player called ‘Werewolf Rush’, this event has a chance of happening on even or odd terms, so if the player is lucky, they will not take damage. There is a loop that tells the player the time of day and warns them when the event is about to happen, as well as when they are hungry. Each time this cycle resets, the number of days alive is increased, and if the player has any generators, the amount is added to the resources and resource score. At the end of the game, the players score, and days survived are displayed.
